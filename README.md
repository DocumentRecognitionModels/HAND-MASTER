# HTR-JAND: Handwritten Text Recognition with Joint Attention Network and Knowledge Distillation chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.18524

This model is designed for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and supports both teacher-student training paradigms as well as ensemble methods. It allows simultaneous training of teacher and student models, or training of a student model from a pretrained teacher or an ensemble of teachers.

### The code is being refined and documented for improved clarity. It will be available here shortly. Thank you for your patience!
