# HAND-MASTER: Handwritten Attention Network with Distillation - Multiple Attention and Sequential Training for Enhanced Recognition
This model is designed for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) and supports both teacher-student training paradigms as well as ensemble methods. It allows simultaneous training of teacher and student models, or training of a student model from a pretrained teacher or an ensemble of teachers.

### The code is being refined and documented for improved clarity. It will be available here shortly. Thank you for your patience!
